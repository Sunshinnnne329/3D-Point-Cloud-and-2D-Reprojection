For this question you must complete the following functions: 

compute_point_cloud.m
compute_2D_projection.m

First you have to start with 'compute_point_cloud.m'. This function is 
about the first part of the question 2. 

When you are successfully done with the first part, you may proceed 
to the second function 'compute_2D_projection.m'.

You may create your own functions and files here too, but please do not
create any new folders. For grading your assignment, my grader code
would call these two functions. When you are done completing these two
functions, you may compress the current folder ('Q2') in '.zip' format ('Q2.zip')
and submit that to mycourses. Make sure that you remove any extra files or
images. You do not need to include the images that we have provided you. 
Those are just for you to test. Also, make sure not to include your pre-computed
point cloud. I will test your code anyways. Add your movie results 
as well (e.g. 'XZ.avi', first letter is for rotation, second for translation).
